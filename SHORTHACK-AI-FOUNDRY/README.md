## 🚀 Getting Started

### Choose Your Setup Method

This workshop supports two setup approaches. Choose the one that best fits your needs:

#### **Option 1: DevContainer Setup** (Recommended)
- ✅ **Fully automated** - Everything pre-configured and ready to use
- ✅ **Consistent environment** - Works the same on any OS
- ✅ **Zero conflicts** - Isolated from your local machine
- ⚠️ **Requires**: Docker Desktop (2-3 GB download)

👉 **[Follow the DevContainer Setup Guide](docs/setup-with-devcontainer.md)**

#### **Option 2: Local Setup** (More Control)
- ✅ **Direct control** - Full access to your local environment
- ✅ **Lighter weight** - No Docker required
- ✅ **Familiar tools** - Use your existing Python installation
- ⚠️ **Requires**: Manual configuration of Python and dependencies

👉 **[Follow the Local Setup Guide](docs/setup-without-devcontainer.md)**

### Prerequisites

**For All Users:**
- **Azure Subscription** - [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- **Visual Studio Code** - [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Azure AI Foundry Project** - Set up through [Azure AI Foundry Portal](https://ai.azure.com)

**For DevContainer Setup:**
- Docker Desktop installed and running
