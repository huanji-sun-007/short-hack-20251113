    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you've learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create specialized AI agents** - Each agent has a specific role (priority assessment, team assignment, effort estimation)\n",
    "2. **Connect agents using tools** - Used `ConnectedAgentTool` to enable inter-agent communication\n",
    "3. **Coordinate multiple agents** - Created a primary triage agent that orchestrates the specialized agents\n",
    "4. **Process complex tasks** - Demonstrated how multiple agents can collaborate to analyze support tickets comprehensively\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Breaking down complex tasks into specialized roles\n",
    "- **Connected Agents**: Agents can call other agents as tools to leverage their expertise\n",
    "- **Orchestration**: A coordinator agent manages the workflow and combines insights from multiple agents\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent focuses on a single responsibility, making the system more maintainable and scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extend this multi-agent system by:\n",
    "- Adding more specialized agents (e.g., severity classifier, customer impact assessor)\n",
    "- Implementing custom tools for specific business logic\n",
    "- Integrating with real ticketing systems\n",
    "- Adding monitoring and analytics capabilities\n",
