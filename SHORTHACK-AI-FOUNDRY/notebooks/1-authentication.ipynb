    "# Authentication with DefaultAzureCredential\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "DefaultAzureCredential is the recommended way to handle authentication in Azure applications. It provides a streamlined authentication flow by trying multiple credential types in sequence until one succeeds. This notebook will help you troubleshoot common authentication issues and ensure proper setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding DefaultAzureCredential\n",
    "\n",
    "DefaultAzureCredential attempts authentication methods in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Environment Credentials\n",
    "2. Workload Identity (in Kubernetes)\n",
    "3. Managed Identity\n",
    "4. Azure CLI Credentials\n",
    "5. Azure PowerShell Credentials\n",
    "6. Visual Studio Code Credentials\n",
    "7. Interactive Browser Authentication (as fallback)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure you have the following installed:\n",
    "- Azure CLI\n",
    "- Azure Developer CLI (optional)\n",
    "- Required role assignments (Azure AI Developer)\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook environment - kernel configured to use Python 3.8 or later\n",
