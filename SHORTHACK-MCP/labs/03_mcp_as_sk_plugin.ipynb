    "# 🧪 Lab 3: Use an MCP Server as a Plugin in a Semantic Kernel Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll learn how to **extend a Semantic Kernel agent** by connecting it to an **MCP server**. MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows agents to invoke external tools, services, or other agents as plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll specifically:\n",
    "- Connect to **your own Codebeamer MCP server** (which you built in **Lab 2**) as a tool via `MCPStreamableHttpPlugin`\n",
    "- Create a **Semantic Kernel agent** powered by Azure OpenAI\n",
    "- Use the MCP plugin inside the agent to access Codebeamer functionality\n",
    "- Interact with the agent through a chat interface\n",
    "- See the agent automatically call functions on the Codebeamer MCP server to answer questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab showcases how Semantic Kernel can leverage **modular, tool-augmented AI workflows** by treating external MCP servers as powerful extensions to the agent's reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this lab:\n",
    "1. **Complete Lab 2** - You need the Codebeamer MCP server running on `http://localhost:8080`\n",
    "2. **Azure OpenAI credentials** - Ensure your `.env` file is configured with:\n",
    "   - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`\n",
    "   - `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`\n",
    "   - `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`\n",
    "   - `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_API_VERSION`\n",
    "3. **Start your MCP server** - Run `python3 servers/mcp_server.py` in a terminal\n",

    "### MCPStreamableHttpPlugin\n",
    "- Enables Semantic Kernel to connect to MCP servers via HTTP\n",
    "- Handles tool discovery and invocation automatically\n",
    "- Supports async operations for better performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### AzureResponsesAgent\n",
    "- A Semantic Kernel agent powered by Azure OpenAI\n",
    "- Can accept multiple plugins for tool augmentation\n",
    "- Maintains conversation context with threads\n",
    "- Automatically decides when to invoke tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool-Augmented AI\n",
    "- LLMs can be extended with external tools and APIs\n",
    "- MCP provides a standardized protocol for tool integration\n",
    "- Agents can reason about when and how to use tools\n",
    "- This enables AI to interact with real-world systems and data\n",

    "\n",
    "## 💡 Challenge Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these extensions to deepen your understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Plugin Agent**: Add the Wikipedia MCP server from Lab 1 alongside Codebeamer\n",
    "2. **Custom Instructions**: Modify the agent to specialize in specific Codebeamer workflows\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**: Add try-catch blocks and graceful error messages\n",
    "4. **Logging**: Track which tools are called and why\n",
    "5. **Build Your Own**: Create a completely new MCP server and integrate it!"
