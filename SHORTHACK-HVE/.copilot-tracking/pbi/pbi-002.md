# Product Backlog Item: Terraform Infrastructure for Fruit Prices API

**PBI ID:** PBI-002  
**Title:** Add Terraform IaC for Fruit Prices API  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Dependencies:** PBI-001 (Daily Fruit Prices API)

## User Story
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** Terraform infrastructure as code for the fruit prices API  
**So that** the API infrastructure can be deployed consistently and managed efficiently  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create Terraform configuration for API infrastructure
- [ ] Define resources for compute, storage, and networking
- [ ] Support multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] Include database setup for fruit price data
- [ ] Configure load balancer and auto-scaling
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
- [ ] Secure network configuration with proper access controls

## Infrastructure Components
- **Compute:** Container service or VM instances for API
- **Database:** Managed database service for fruit price storage
- **Networking:** VPC, subnets, security groups, load balancer
- **Storage:** Object storage for logs and backups
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch/Azure Monitor equivalent setup
